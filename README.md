# Crystal Collector

Welcome to Crystal Collector.  This game is a fun challenege for using jQuery!

The page will load and you will notice a plane page.  The layout here wasn't the focus.  The focus was getting the game to function properly.  There are instructions for playing the game clearly written out.  

Under the directions, you will see a number.  This is the number you must match by clicking on the crystals.  Each crystal has a random value assigned to it.  Each time a crystal is clicked, your score will go up by the value of that crystal.

The score is listed in the box under the crystals.  If you go over the number above the crystals, you will lose and the game will automatically reset.  If you guess the number exactly, then you win!  Your score will be tallied and the game will reset.

Have fun!
